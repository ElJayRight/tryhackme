Overview
During pre-auth, the users hash will be used to encrypt a timestamp that the DC will attempt to decrypt to validate that the right has is being used. After validating the timestamp the KDC will then issue a TGT for the user. If pre-auth is disabeld you can request any auth data for any user and the KDC will return an encrypted TGT.
